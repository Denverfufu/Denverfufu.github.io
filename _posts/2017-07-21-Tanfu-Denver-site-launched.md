Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Being a senior graduated student in National Taiwan University means that I have to do my utmost on my research progress. Seeing what my lab classmates have done, which I should not mimic, is insane ridiculous. Recently, I list all the things that I need to do and make some progress, it is such a long list that I don't even know whether I can totally succeed doing it or not. However, I should not question myself, all I have to do is try my best and conquer those things.<br>
I know there is still a lot to improve myself, and a huge gap between me in reality and the man I eager to become. Remember : Having faith is the only way.<br>
This diary is just practice, hoping my english level will eventually improve more. Don't forget you have the potential to score high in TOEFL, which means you can definitely become a pro.<br><p>
