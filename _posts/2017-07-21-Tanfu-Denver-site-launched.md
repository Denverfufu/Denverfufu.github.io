Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Being a senior graduated student in National Taiwan University means that I have to do my utmost on my research progress. Seeing what my lab classmates have done, which I should not mimic, is insane ridiculous. Recently, I list all the things that I need to do and make some progress, it is such a long list that I don't even know whether I can totally succeed doing it or not. However, I should not question myself, all I have to do is try my best and conquer those things.
I know there is still a lot to improve myself, and a huge gap between me in reality and the man I eager to become. Remember : Having faith is the only way.
This diary is just practice, hoping my english level will eventually improve more. Don't forget you have the potential to score high in TOEFL, which means you can definitely become a pro.
Cheer up!
